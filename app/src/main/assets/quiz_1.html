      {q:"Which type of variable remains the same throughout an experiment?", options:["Dependent","Controlled","Extraneous","Independent"], answer:1, explanation:"Controlled variables are kept constant to ensure fairness in experiments."},
      {q:"The SI unit of electric current is:", options:["Joule","Ampere","Watt","Volt"], answer:1, explanation:"Ampere (A) measures electric current."},

      // Medium Level
      {q:"Which of the following is an extraneous variable in a plant growth experiment?", options:["Amount of sunlight","Type of plant","Plant height","Temperature"], answer:3, explanation:"Temperature is not the main focus but can affect results unintentionally."},
      {q:"Which of the following is NOT a fundamental unit?", options:["Candela","Kelvin","Newton","Mole"], answer:2, explanation:"Newton is derived from fundamental units."},

      {q:"What does the “analysis” step in the scientific method involve?", options:["Guessing","Drawing graphs, interpreting data","Repeating experiments blindly","Discarding failed results"], answer:1, explanation:"Analysis means processing data to find patterns or conclusions."},
      {q:"Which statement about controlled variables is correct?", options:["They change constantly","They are not recorded","They are kept the same throughout the experiment","They determine the dependent variable"], answer:2, explanation:"Controlled variables prevent external factors from influencing results."},
      {q:"Which metric unit is 1/100 of a metre?", options:["Millimetre","Centimetre","Decimetre","Kilometre"], answer:1, explanation:"Centi means 1/100 of the base unit."},
      {q:"Why does dimensional correctness not guarantee numerical correctness?", options:["Because units may be wrong","Because numbers may be incorrect even if units match","Because SI units are not universal","Because measurements are always approximate"], answer:1, explanation:"An equation can be dimensionally valid but still yield wrong numerical results."},
      {q:"Which SI base unit measures the amount of substance?", options:["Mole","Candela","Kelvin","Ampere"], answer:0, explanation:"Mole (mol) measures the quantity of matter in terms of particles."},
      {q:"“King Henry Died By Drinking Chocolate Milk” helps remember:", options:["Variable types","Metric unit prefixes","Scientific method steps","Equation derivations"], answer:1, explanation:"It’s a mnemonic for kilo, hecto, deca, base, deci, centi, milli."},

      {q:"The SI unit of luminous intensity is:", options:["Lumen","Candela","Lux","Watt"], answer:1, explanation:"Candela is the base unit for luminous intensity."},
      {q:"Which step of the scientific method comes immediately after forming a hypothesis?", options:["Observation","Analysis","Experiment","Conclusion"], answer:2, explanation:"The experiment tests the hypothesis formed after observation."},
      // Hard Level
      {q:"In the formula for work, W = F × d, what is the derived SI unit of work?", options:["Joule","Watt","Newton","Pascal"], answer:0, explanation:"Force (Newton) × distance (metre) = Joule (N·m)."},
      {q:"Which combination of base units gives the unit of power (watt)?", options:["kg·m²/s³","kg·m/s²","kg·m/s³","m²/s²"], answer:0, explanation:"Power = Work/time, Joule/s = (kg·m²/s²)/s = kg·m²/s³."},
      {q:"A student writes the equation speed = distance × time. Dimensional analysis shows:", options:["It is dimensionally correct","It is dimensionally incorrect","It is correct only for certain units","Cannot be checked"], answer:1, explanation:"Dimensions: m × s ≠ m/s, so it’s wrong."},
      {q:"Which of the following variables can be both independent and dependent depending on the experiment?", options:["Temperature","Plant type","Soil type","Humidity"], answer:0, explanation:"In some experiments, temperature is controlled; in others, it is the measured outcome."},
      {q:"Why is Kelvin preferred over Celsius in scientific work?", options:["Kelvin is more accurate","Kelvin avoids negative temperatures","Celsius is not SI accepted","Kelvin is easier to measure"], answer:1, explanation:"Kelvin starts from absolute zero, making it suitable for scientific calculations."},
      {q:"A formula for area is A = l × b. If l is in cm and b in m, dimensional analysis will:", options:["Show the formula is wrong","Show units need conversion for correctness","Show it’s correct as is","Be impossible"], answer:1, explanation:"Mixed units require conversion before calculation."},
      {q:"An equation gives force in kg·m/s³. Dimensional analysis reveals:", options:["It’s correct","It’s incorrect","It’s in watts","It’s in joules"], answer:1, explanation:"Force should be kg·m/s²; s³ indicates an error."},
      {q:"If an equation is dimensionally correct, it means:", options:["It is also numerically correct","It may still be numerically incorrect","The units are wrong","The constants are zero"], answer:1, explanation:"Dimensional correctness ensures unit consistency, not numerical accuracy."}
